# XML configuration reader
This library introduces an interface `IConfigurationReader` and a default implementation `ConfigurationReader`.
This very simple service provides a way to avoid some of the boilerplate code when getting a `System.Configuration.ConfigurationSection` from an XML configuration file.

## Getting a section from its default path
```csharp
IConfigurationReader reader = GetConfigurationReader();

var myConfig = reader.ReadSection<MyConfigurationSection>();
```

By default, the configuration file path queried is based upon namespace-qualified-name of the configuration section.
Periods are replaced with slashes and the result used as the path.
In the following example, the reader would look in the path `Foo/Bar/Baz/MyConfigurationSection`.

```csharp
namespace Foo.Bar.Baz
{
  public class MyConfigurationSection : ConfigurationSection { /* Implementation omitted */ }
}
```

## Specifying the default path in an attribute
You may override the default path at which the reader looks for a configuration section, using an attribute.
In the following example, the reader would look in the path `my/custom/path`, ignoring the namespace and type name.

```csharp
namespace Foo.Bar.Baz
{
  [ConfigurationPath("my/custom/path")]
  public class MyConfigurationSection : ConfigurationSection { /* Implementation omitted */ }
}
```

## Specifying a path
If a string parameter is provided to the `ReadSection<T>` method, then the specified path is used, and neither of the two mechanisms above are used.

## Getting just the default path
Finally, the reader provides a method to get the default path for a section.
This returns either the path specified by an attribute (if it is present), or the path based upon the namespace-qualified-name:

```csharp
var path = reader.GetDefaultSectionPath<MyConfigurationSection>();
```
