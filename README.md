# Configuration helper
This library introduces the **`ConfigurationHelper`** static class.
It has a few useful methods, which largely function as shortcuts for calls to
`System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager`.

* `GetSection<T>` - gets a typed configuration section

* `GetDefaultConfigurationPath<T>` - gets a default 'path' (in the XML structure) to a section

The concept of a default path simply uses the type's namespaces to determine
where in an XML configuration structure it should exist.
Thus the following configuration type:

```csharp
namespace Sample.Application
{
  public class MyConfig : ConfigurationSection
  {
    // Implementation here
  }
}
```

â€¦ would exist at the following location:

```xml
<Sample>
  <Application>
    <MyConfig />
  </Application>
</Sample>
```

The parameterless overload of `GetSection<T>` assumes that the section is
located at that configuration path.
The other overload permits the passing of a string indicating the path.
